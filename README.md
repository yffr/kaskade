# kaskade stylesheet

*100%* free to use, edit, copy, etc. (![license](https://codeberg.org/gfr/kaskade/src/branch/master/basedLICENSE))  
*100%* js free, class/id free, and clutter free

## why use this?

i dunno - <span style='color:#66f'>kaskade</a> was made because of the lack of <b>ultraminimal</b> stylesheets <i>without</i> classes or identities constantly being used ... that's what the tags are for - you want bold? use <\b>! you want italics? use <\i>! you want an underline? use <\u> ... these don't all need their own classes - its <\span class='italics'> vs <\i> ... so use this little theme i've made for myself as you wish (in accordance with the license)

i'm looking for ways to pair this >400B stylesheet template with a markdown static site generator - if you know how ... uhh, cool ... you can contact me if you like ![here](https://stop.voring.me/@gfr)
